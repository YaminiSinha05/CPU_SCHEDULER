# CPU_SCHEDULER
The CPU Scheduler project features a dynamic Gantt Chart UI that visualizes the execution of various scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling. Users input process details such as arrival time, burst time, and priority (if applicable), and the system calculates key metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and completion time. The Gantt Chart is color-coded for each process, with an interactive timeline displaying execution order, start, and end times. Hovering over a process reveals detailed execution data, enhancing clarity. Below the chart, a process table presents scheduling results, while additional graphical representations compare performance metrics across different algorithms, ensuring an intuitive and analytical user experience.
